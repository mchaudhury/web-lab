Internet is a work of wonder. The concept of internet may seem complicated,but it is really simple. To understand internet we must first need to understand what a network is. A network, in simplified terms, is a number of interconnected computers intended for sharing of data from one computer to another. A simple network is 2 interconnected computers and complex network is many computers connected together via cables. When many different networks are connected through routers(another type of computer) we get the internet. How internet works is that many computers are connected to a router so one computer doesn't send data over to the wrong computer. When a network gets too big, then we connect multiple router to each other to form a giant network i.e the internet. This is how the data is shared. However for resudential use when it is not possible to connect home computers to worldwide networks via cable. Hence a modem(a electronic device) is used where the modem transforms the information from the internet networks into data that ca be accessed via the telephone infrastructure. Nowadays, the internet data can be accesed via wireless router as well.


The link that you click on a browser on your computer(client-side computer) has a unique adress called URL. This is actually the web adress of the page you want to visit. The browser, after you click, will find the name of the website via Domain Name System. The domain name is the plain english name that will be translated into the numerical adress (i.e IP adress) so that the computer can access the webpage via that number. After that the browser will open a communication channel to the website over the Intenet Protocol. The web browser then connects to the HTTP (Hypertest Transfer Protocol) server that has the webpage. After connection i.e. the request, the server will send the webpage as a response.
